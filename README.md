Features

 â€¢ Classic Snake Gameplay: Control the snake and try to grow it as large as possible by eating food.
 â€¢ Responsive Music Player: Play, pause, and switch between tracks while playing the game.
 â€¢ Dynamic Game Speed: The game speed increases as the player progresses.
 â€¢ Score Tracking: Display the current score during gameplay.
